Intellihire team development sourcetree :)


How can companies find the right people to hire - and how can potential employees find the right company?

Problem
HR talent management and recruiting for efficient candidate - job matching.

State-of-the-art
Psychometric tests and interviews are both complementary and competitive as techniques for job selection.
Classical psychometric tests function by summing the scores from pre-designated items within a test to form scales that represent particular traits of ability or personality. 
The subtle underlying interactions between these items and the patterns they form are ignored. 
It is still the insight of human interviewers into the complexities of interviewees' responses that has always provided the verdict.

Proposed solution
Using expert systems and neural programming to learn the complex patterns that exist among and between the responses to items in questionnaires. 
These could represent crucial aspects of human personality if only they could be made available to human resource professionals.
In a more extended context, such a learning system will be able to recognise patterns that lie within the inherent complexity of the human character, beyond the level of the simple trait.

Tools

ANFIS - adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system

Using a given input/output data set, the system constructs a fuzzy inference system whose membership function parameters are tuned using back propagation and a least squares optimization. This adjustment allows the fuzzy system to learn from the data it is modeling.
